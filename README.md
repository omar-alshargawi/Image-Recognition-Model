🍇 Fruit Classifier using Teachable Machine & Keras

Grape vs. Apple Classification

This project is a simple image classification tool that detects between grapes and apples using a model trained with Google's Teachable Machine and deployed via a Python script using Keras.

🎯 Project Goal

Learn how to:

Train a custom image classification model using Teachable Machine

Export the model in TensorFlow Keras format

Load and use the model in Python

Preprocess input images and predict their class

Test multiple images and view confidence scores

📦 Tools & Technologies

Google Teachable Machine (Image Project)

TensorFlow / Keras

Python (PIL, NumPy)

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab / VS Code

GitHub for version control

🍇 Classes Used

The model is trained to classify between:

Grape 🍇 

Apple 🍎

🧪 How It Works

Load the model and labels

Preprocess the image to 224x224 and normalize

Predict the class with confidence score

Print the result with grape shown first
